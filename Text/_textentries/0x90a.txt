#ruby ran out of Dust
[MidRight][LoadRuby]
Ack! I knew I forgot something![N]
I don't have any [Red]Dust[Red] left![AN]
[MidLeft][LoadQrow]
Remember this, Ruby.[AN]
If you're using a Dust-powered[N]
weapon like Crescent Rose,[AN]
always carry some spare Dust.[AN]
Otherwise, you could find[N]
yourself without a weapon[AN]
at the worst possible time.[AN]
I've got some Dust crystals,[N]
you can use them to reload.[A][X]
